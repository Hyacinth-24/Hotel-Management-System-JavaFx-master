## Introduction:  
Hotel management System is a desktop application where users
can book hotel room, review about the hotel service. Managers
can manage rooms, book rooms for new customers. And the admin of this application can create,
update and delete employees for their application and can also
see the total earnings from their hotel.

with this application than they used to keep track of all details
manually in their ledger. The customers, managers and the
employees can be more happy with this new system.
